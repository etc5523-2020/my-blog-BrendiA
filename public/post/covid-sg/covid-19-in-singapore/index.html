<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Undoubtedly, The COVID-19 pandemic will have altered personal lives, be it enormous or minor. There will be many stories told of how they ‘survived’ this pandemic down the road, having to fight for toilet papers and socially distancing from people outside. As a student, I’d like to add that group assignments studying online is a chore when you can’t have face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>When I think about the detrimental implications of COVID-19, jobs and economy come to my mind. In Singapore, this pandemic has caused significant downturns for major industries, resulting to an the unemployment rate of 2.9% (<span class="citation">Phua (<a href="#ref-sgjobs" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), an all-time high since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>My first blog post will feature a short story of the COVID-19 situation in my home country, Singapore. I will first study the trends in COVID-19 cases in Singapore. Here, I will break down the observations into 4 distinct components relating to the lockdown restrictions and give a short data story. Next, I will investigate the broad economical impact of COVID-19 on the different sectors of Singapore’s economy by examining the nation’s GDP. Notably, each section will have interactive components to articulate the findings better.</p>
</div>
<div id="covid-19-cases-in-singapore" class="section level1">
<h1>COVID-19 Cases in Singapore</h1>
<div id="getting-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting the Data</h2>
<p>To analyse the COVID-19 cases, I extracted the daily summary of Singapore’s COVID-19 cases in the <code>coronavirus</code> package. This package contains the raw data in a tidy format, summarising the daily cases by state/province and is readily available on <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus">GitHub</a>. Each observation represents the total number of cases recorded in the state/province, where each cases are identified by their case type, spanning from 2020-01-23. It was really convenient to use this data set as minimal data wrangling had to be done.</p>
<p>The main variables that were utilised from the data set were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>date</code>: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format</p></li>
<li><p><code>type</code>: Type of cases (confirmed, death or recovered)</p></li>
<li><p><code>cases</code>: Number of cases on a given date</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="findings" class="section level2">
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p><img src="/post/covid-sg/2020-09-01-covid-19-in-singapore.en_files/figure-html/plot-cases-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>The figure displays the number of new cases in Singapore daily by each case type. The the x-axis represents each date while the y-axis shows the number of new cases on a given day. To investigate the trends further, I have broken down the dates into four components, each represented by a colour in the plot. As a brief overview of the lockdown procedures, Singapore went into lockdown on April 7 (<span class="citation">Woo (<a href="#ref-woo2020policy" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). These restrictions were carried out till the June 1 before Singapore entered the ‘reopening phases’. These phases were tentative, depending on the COVID-19 cases recorded. As of today (Sep 4), phase 1 lasted till 17/06 and the country is currently in phase 2, known as the “Safe Transition”.</p>
<p>A marked escalation of new COVID-19 cases can be observed in early April,although lockdown and social distancing protocols were in effect. At a glance, it seems that Singapore was rather too late in tightening its restrictions and this could be avoided. Thereafter, the cases gradually decreases before soaring again in end July and early August.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, this increase can be attributed to the surge in infections among migrant worker population staying in dormitories (<span class="citation">Sim and Kok (<a href="#ref-sgdorm" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). The impact of COVID-19 revealed that thousands of low-skilled migrant workers in Singapore lived in poor housing conditions. For instance, many migrant workers had “20 people sharing a single room” (<span class="citation">Zhuo (<a href="#ref-sgdorm2" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) where social distancing was too difficult to practice. In a pandemic, these living environment could serve as flash points for a further spread, as seen in the figure (<span class="citation">Koh (<a href="#ref-Koh634" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). As of 6 May, there were 17,758 confirmed COVID-19 cases among dormitory workers (approximately 90% of 20,000 nationally confirmed cases) (<span class="citation">Koh (<a href="#ref-Koh634" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Although the confirmed cases were higher in Singapore, the fatality rate of COVID-19 cases were insignificant as compared to the new cases, staying relatively constant at 0. Is it a matter of chance where the people who were infected were healthy? At first, studies indicated that this coincidence may be due to the prevalence of testing as the Singapore’s screening program comprises of young and even asymptotic people (<span class="citation">Scott (<a href="#ref-sgdeaths" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). Of course, the efforts of first line workers should never downplayed; And these assertions were quickly invalidated as research proved that salient factors other other than patient characteristics that determine Covid-19 mortality, such as government response are more prominent (liang2020covid).</p>
<p>At the heart of Singapore’s operational capacity is its healthcare system, ranked among the top in the world, the healthcare system has been described as ‘high quality, low cost’. In 2019 itself,The National Centre for Infectious diseases (NCID) installed bed purpose built facility that were designed to manage an outbreak on the scale of SARS, allowing for excess capacity of patients (liang2020covid).</p>
<p>Not to mention, the government was largely successful in contact tracing, and instilled a hefty penalty for the defiance of lockdown restrictions - fined up to $9,500 and/or up to six months of imprisonment. Furthermore, Singapore’s Changi Airport terminal 2 will cease operations for 18 months to prevent the importation of COVID-19 cases (<span class="citation">Asquith (<a href="#ref-sgairport" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). Therefore, the gradual decrease in the number of cases as seen on the figure may be a results of these stringent lockdown restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="interactive-covid-19-cases-in-singapore" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactive: Covid-19 Cases in Singapore</h2>
<p>I have created a an interactive table to insinuate what was emphasised in the data story. Here, the values of the each lockdown phase are coloured (like in the plot above) to better visualise the trend/results.</p>

<h1>COVID-19 Impact on Singapore’s Economy</h1>
<div id="getting-the-data-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting the Data</h2>
<p>Next, to study the economical impact of COVID-19, I download the quarterly Gross Domestic Product(GDP) at Current Prices" from the <a href="https://www.tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/publicfacing/createDataTable.action?refId=16059">Department of Statistics Singapore website</a> (<span class="citation">Statistics Singapore (<a href="#ref-sggdp" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). In terms of the data cleaning process, the data was transposed before I removed unnecessary variables and renamed variables names such that they are consistent and comprising of only characters, numbers, lower case letters, with spaces denoted with underscores.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p><img src="/post/covid-sg/2020-09-01-covid-19-in-singapore.en_files/figure-html/plot-industry-gdp-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>As we understand the COVID-19 situation in Singapore better, we delve into investigating which industries and sector are most adversely affected by the pandemic. The figure implies that COVID-19 had severely disrupted the economical activities of the goods and services industries in Singapore. Intuitively, we can expect demand and supply shocks as a result of the measures introduced by the government to contain the outbreak. From a supplier’s point of view, the widespread curtailment of economic activity will cause global supply chain disruptions, which will in turn affect the local businesses. Conversely, the global recession will take a toll on the demands for the local goods. For instance, Singapore’s Changi Airport terminal 2 will cease operations for 18 months to curb the importation of COVID-19 cases (<span class="citation">Asquith (<a href="#ref-sgairport" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>).</p>

<h2>Interactive plot: COVID-19 impact on GDP</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there will be no data story for this section, BUT, I have included an interactive plot to fiddle around with! Here, I have further broken down the industries to each sector. From the graph, it can be ascertained that some sectors were hit harder than the other sectors within the same industry!</p>

<h2>Interactive Table: COVID-19 impact on GDP</h2>
<p>I have also included an interactive table. In this table, the first three variables after date represents the sector’s GDP and its relative quarterly change. Following these column, the remaining variables represents the industry’s GDP, which comprises of GDP for goods producing industries, services producing industries and the total aggregated GDP of the industries with its relative change. A good use of this table is to compare the relative change between the sector’s GDP and the total GDP. Also, we can use this table to compare what we found in the interactive plot!</p>
