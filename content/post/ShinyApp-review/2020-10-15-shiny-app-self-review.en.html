<h2>The Shiny App</h2>
<p>The Shiny App was created to provide key data visualisations and allow users to explore Covid-19 cases across the U.S states. The interactive features allow for a more personalised user experience, to explore as little or as much of the analysed data. In all tabs, one can use the slider input and drop down list to manoeuvre between dates and states across the United States to visualise how the Covid-19 trajectories changes with these inputs.</p>

<h3>Tab 1: United States COVID-19 Cases (per 100,000) by State</h3>
<p>[<em>Add video/image</em>]</p>
<p>This tab provides the confirmed Covid-19 cases, per 100,000 population that were reported by the state on a given date (<em>Reference to NY Times</em>). The U.S. state map provides a sequential colour scale of the total confirmed cases</p>
<p>The total confirmed cases is plotted on the U.S state map, and is made with a sequential colour scale to establish the geographical location in which the total confirmed cases are the highest. This trend is also plotted on a histogram on the side bar panel, as I thought the trend can be better articulated since people are generally better at comparing lengths on a common scale as compared to shading or colour saturations (<span class="citation">@cleveland1984graphical</span>).</p>
<p>As a case in point, it can be observed in this tab that after New York surpassed Washington on the 16th March 2020 in the total number of Covid-19 cases, they have since led the United States in this aspect up till this date.</p>
<p>The dataset for this component originates from the NY Times (<em>Reference</em>).</p>

<h3>Tab 2: Positive Results in Covid-19 testing</h3>
<p>Covid-19 testing promotes early detection of community-acquired Covid-19 cases, which can support in public health response to the pandemic such as the allocation of resources for the more vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>This section will demonstrate the daily proportion of tests returning positive on the U.S state map</p>
