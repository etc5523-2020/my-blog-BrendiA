<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has altered people’s lives, be it enormous or minute. Undoubtedly, there will be many stories told of how they ‘survived’ this pandemic down the road, fighting for toilet papers and masks and how bumping elbows were the norm etc. As a student, I’d like to add that group assignments studying online is a chore when you can’t have face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>My first blog post is a short story of the COVID-19 situation in my home country, Singapore.</p>
<div id="data-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Description</h2>
<p><code>coronavirus</code> depicts details of coronavirus cases for all countries from 22-01-2020. It is in a long format where each observation represents a detailed summary of COVID-19 cases by country. I’ve chosen to use this data set in conjunction with the <code>merged_df</code> data set the data is in a long format and will be handy when plotting and constructing tables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># From coronavirus package: long format of covid cases
sg_long &lt;- coronavirus %&gt;% 
  filter(country == &quot;Singapore&quot;) %&gt;%
  select(-province) # No province in Singapore

# Load data for all countries
merged_df &lt;- download_merged_data(cached = TRUE, silent = TRUE) 

sg_df &lt;- merged_df %&gt;%
  filter(country == &quot;Singapore&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In this blog, three main data sets will be used.</p>

<p>Why so little death? Is it attributed to great hospital equipment? Were there times when hospitals were over capacity?</p>
<p><em>Observations</em><br />
- People recover in about 2 weeks
- Very low death rates, almost 0</p>
